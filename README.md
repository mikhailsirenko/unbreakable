# What is unbreakable?
Unbreakable is a stochastic simulation model for assessing the resilience of households to natural disasters. 

Resilience here is an ability of a household to bounce back to the consumption level it had before the disaster.

The model is disaster-agnostic


## Introduction

## Features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
The model is developed in Python 3.9 and relies on standard packages. The easiest way to install them is to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) with the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
conda create --name unbreakable --file requirements.txt
```

### Installation
Clone the repository from GitHub using the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikhailsirenko/unbreakable
```

### Usage
You run the model from the command line with the default parameters using:
```bash
python unbreakable/__main__.py
```

### Examples

## Documentation
Detailed model documentation, including function descriptions and usage examples, is available [here](https://mikhailsirenko.github.io/unbreakable/src.html).
